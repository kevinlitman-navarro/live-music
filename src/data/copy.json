{"hed":"Introducing the Live Music Jukebox","dek":"Dek here etc","byline":"by Kat Wilson and Kevin Litman-Navarro","Intro1":"It’s been a long time since we’ve seen live music. Of course, with modern streaming platforms, there’s more than enough recorded music to keep us safely locked down ad infinitum; yet there remains a deficiency in our musical diets amidst the plague of cancelled shows and closed venues.","Intro2":"What exactly do we miss? Is it the random banter outside of the lyrics we know by heart? A slow jam revived as an up-tempo frenzy? The spontaneous, five-minute guitar solos? A banger gone acoustic? Or the solidarity of strangers in the audience who love that band as much as you do? Maybe it’s the surrounding context of the show (Johnny Cash’s prison performances, Nirvana’s intimate NYC acoustic set, or LCD Soundsystem’s “final goodbye” Madison Square Garden show), that give us insight into what was going on with the audience, the artist, and the world, at the time of the performance.","pullquote":"“As music becomes less of a thing–a cylinder, a cassette, a disc–and more ephemeral, perhaps we will begin to assign an increasing value to live performances again.” — David Byrne, Talking Heads","Intro3":"In the time before we can go back to crowding Brooklyn Steel or catching an intimate set at Hole in the Wall, we decided to dive into the vast discography of live-recorded albums to try and satiate the desire to catch a show. First, we found as many live albums as we could and matched them to their studio counterparts using the SpotifyAPI, which includes data on each track that attempts to numerically measure what a song sounds like. Then, by looking at the differences between live and studio songs using metrics like energy (how intense or lively a track sounds), valence (a measurement of a song’s mood), and duration (to find those five-minute guitar solos), we found great live performances that we had missed.","BD1":"For instance, Bob Dylan’s Blowin’ in the Wind doesn’t exactly come to mind as the encore to end a cross country stadium tour. The folk ballad is typically sung at a slow, ticking rate; it sounds almost like a lullaby. Dylan metronomically recites the lyrics over a simple acoustic strumming pattern, only pausing for a short, intimate, harmonica break in the middle. When analyzing the data, we noticed that the live-recorded version of the song, off of Before the Flood, is, by contrast, a frenzied, five-minute celebration.","BD2":"Recorded at the Los Angeles Forum during the tail end of Dylan’s 1974 American tour with The Band, the artist (and the audience) take on a new energy. Listen to the difference below.","BD3":"In this version, fans cheer, and the drums pick up in the background as you hear Dylan’s voice creak over the mic. A guitar solo halfway through replaces Dylan’s studio harmonica, and almost ten seconds of applause linger on as he shouts “Thank you, Goodnight!”  It’s as if, over the backdrop of a nation closer to the end of the Vietnam War that first inspired the song, the lyrics take on a different tone.","TH1":"Other changes are more intentional. David Byrne, for instance, made the choice, when recording three live shows at the Pantages theater in Los Angeles with the Talking Heads, to have each musician and instrument come out onto the stage in succession, one at a time. Byrne was inspired by the minimalist Japanese theater, where stage props and actors were portable, to remove the fourth wall. The resulting performance, captured in the documentary film “Stop Making Sense” brings the audience into the music, creating a type of “build up” approach to sound. You can hear this change in songs like “Heaven,” an acoustic, stripped-down version of the original studio recording.","TH2":"For instance, compare the acoustic levels of Psycho Killer. The song begins the live set, with only David Byrne on an acoustic guitar, accompanied by a simple drum track played over a tape recorder. This live version is a drastically stripped down version of the original studio version, recorded six years earlier. The song “Heaven” takes on a similar change.","AF1":"Levels of speech and instrumentals often seesaw in live performance, too. The iconic saxophone solo in Aretha Franklin’s “Respect,” for example, is certainly not the center of attention, as it is in the studio version. Instead, Aretha’s backup singers take more of a central role. At the Filmore West in San Francisco in 1971, the jam starts out with some stage banter, and the tempo picks up way faster than the studio version. The sax solo is almost “rushed” through, and in its place, backup singers bring even more force to the song.","Jukebox1":"Using this data, we created the Live Music Jukebox. You can search for artists, and find the live tracks stand out the most compared to the studio version. You might even find someone new that you just have to see. With any luck, the Live Music Jukebox can tide you over until you’re back in the mosh pit, head banging and dancing the night away.","Methods":""}
